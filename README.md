# HuskyConnect

## A peer-to-peer tutoring service for UW Students

### Simple
Husky connect allows any UW student in select classes find peers who are currently taking or have taken the class to get one on one tutoring in a less formal enviornment than office hours or an IPL. 

The goal is to empower students to volenteer and help teach other students in the UW community and connect students in need of homework help with people who are willing and able to provide it.
